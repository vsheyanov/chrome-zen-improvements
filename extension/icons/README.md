# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons referenced in manifest.json:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

For now, the extension will work without these icons, but Chrome will use default placeholder icons.

To add custom icons:
1. Create PNG files with the specified dimensions
2. Name them exactly as referenced in manifest.json
3. Place them in this directory

Recommended icon design:
- Simple, recognizable design
- Works well at small sizes
- Consistent with Chrome's design language
- Use transparent backgrounds where appropriate
